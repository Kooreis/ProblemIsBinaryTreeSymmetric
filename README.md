# Question: How do you determine if a binary tree is symmetric? C# Summary

The provided C# code is a console application that determines if a binary tree is symmetric. It first defines a Node class, which represents a node in the binary tree, containing a value and references to left and right child nodes. The main program creates a binary tree and checks if it is symmetric by calling the IsSymmetric method. This method checks if the root is null, in which case it returns true because an empty tree is symmetric. If the root is not null, it calls a second overloaded IsSymmetric method, passing the left and right child nodes of the root. This second method checks if the left and right nodes are null, in which case it returns true if both are null (indicating a symmetric structure) and false otherwise. If neither node is null, it checks if their values are equal. If they are not, it returns false, indicating the tree is not symmetric. If the values are equal, it recursively calls itself twice, once for the left child of the left node and the right child of the right node, and once for the right child of the left node and the left child of the right node. This recursive process continues until all nodes have been checked, and the tree is determined to be symmetric if all corresponding pairs of nodes are equal.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution follows a similar approach to the C# version. Both versions use a recursive function to check if the left and right subtrees of the root node are mirror images of each other. 

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. Class Definition: In Python, the `Node` class is defined using the `class` keyword, and the constructor method is `__init__`. In C#, the `Node` class is also defined using the `class` keyword, but the constructor method is the name of the class itself.

2. Null/None Checking: In Python, `None` is used to represent the absence of a value, and the `is` keyword is used to check if a variable is `None`. In C#, `null` is used to represent the absence of a value, and the `==` operator is used to check if a variable is `null`.

3. Function Definition: In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword. In C#, functions are defined using the `public static` keywords followed by the return type of the function.

4. Main Function: In Python, the main function is defined as a normal function and is executed when the script is run directly (not imported as a module) by checking `__name__ == "__main__"`. In C#, the main function is defined inside a `Program` class and is the entry point of the application.

5. Print Statement: In Python, the `print` function is used to print the output to the console. In C#, the `Console.WriteLine` method is used to print the output to the console.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the solution is similar to the C# version in terms of logic. Both versions use a recursive approach to check if the left and right subtrees of the root are mirror images of each other. If they are, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. Class Definitions: In C#, the `Node` and `Program` classes are defined separately, while in Java, the `Node` class is defined inside the `BinaryTree` class. This is a common practice in Java to encapsulate related classes.

2. User Input: In the Java version, the user is prompted to enter the values for the nodes of the binary tree. This is done using the `Scanner` class, which is part of the Java standard library. In contrast, the C# version hardcodes the values for the nodes.

3. Null Checking: Both versions check if a node is null before proceeding with the recursion. However, the way they do this is slightly different. In C#, the `==` operator is used to compare a node with null, while in Java, the `==` operator is used to compare two nodes for equality.

4. Method Naming: The method that checks if the binary tree is symmetric is named `IsSymmetric` in C# and `isSymmetric` in Java. This is due to the different naming conventions in the two languages. In C#, methods are typically named using PascalCase, while in Java, they are typically named using camelCase.

5. Output: In the C# version, the result is printed to the console using `Console.WriteLine()`. In the Java version, the result is printed using `System.out.println()`. These are the standard ways of printing to the console in C# and Java, respectively.
